| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🍖 BBQ             | Smoky and flavorful, perfect for groups; but high in calories and prep time |

| 🥐 French Cuisine  | Elegant and refined, great for dates; can be pricey and in small portions   |
| 🍗 Fried Chicken   | Crispy, juicy, crowd-pleasing; but oily and high in fat                     |
| 🍳 Homemade        | Healthy, satisfying, and customizable; takes time to prepare                |
| 🍛 Indian Curry    | Rich in spices and flavor; not ideal if you dislike spicy food              |
| 🍝 Italian Food    | Pizza, pasta, all-time favorites; carb-heavy and not diet friendly          |
| 🍜 Japanese Ramen  | Deep broth, multiple toppings; sometimes salty and varies by shop           |
| 🌯 Mexican Burrito | Stuffed and flavorful, good for takeout; heavy and calorie-dense            |
| 🥙 Mediterranean   | Light and healthy with olive oil & veggies; may feel too mild for some      |
| 🍕 Pizza           | Always a winner in groups, lots of variety; easy to overeat                 |

| 🥪 Sandwich        | Fast and easy, perfect on the go; can get boring without variety            |
| 🦞 Seafood         | Fresh and high in protein; more expensive, allergen risk for some           |
| 🥘 Spanish Tapas   | Small plates, great for sharing; not ideal for heavy eaters                 |
| 🥩 Steakhouse      | High-protein and satisfying; usually more expensive, quality varies         |
| 🌮 Tacos           | Fun and flavorful, street-food style; can be messy to eat                   |
| 🥦 Vegan Bowl      | Plant-based, high in fiber; might not appeal to meat lovers                 |
| 🍲 Thai Food       | Sweet, sour, and spicy all in one; may be too spicy for some tastes         |
