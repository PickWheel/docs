# 🌀 Twister Spinner – The Ultimate Twist of Fun!

Feeling flexible? The **[Twister Spinner](https://pickwheel.app/tools/twister-spinner)** on [PickWheel](https://pickwheel.app) brings classic chaos to your screen! Whether you lost the original spinner or just want a digital upgrade, this tool is your perfect Twister companion.

## What is Twister?

**Twister** is a legendary physical party game invented in 1966 by Charles Foley and Neil Rabens. It’s a game of balance, flexibility, and laughter where players place hands and feet on colored circles according to a spinner's call.

It quickly became a cultural icon — known for creating tangled-up bodies, awkward poses, and hilarious moments at parties and gatherings.

## How Do You Play Twister?

🟢 **Set up the mat** with 4 colored rows (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
🌀 **Use the Twister Spinner** to call a move like:

- Right Hand – Red
- Left Foot – Blue
- Left Hand – Green
- Right Foot – Yellow

🧍 Players must place the correct body part on the indicated color — and **stay in position**!

The catch? No falling allowed. As more commands are called, the positions get funnier (and harder). The last player standing (or not toppling over) wins.

## What is the Twister Spinner?

The **Twister Spinner** is the official move-decider. Traditionally it’s a cardboard spinner, but with [PickWheel](https://pickwheel.app), you can spin it digitally with a single tap.

This spinner randomly selects combinations like:

- Left Hand – Blue
- Right Foot – Red
- Left Foot – Yellow
- Right Hand – Green

All possible combos are covered — so the fun (and contortions) never stop.
